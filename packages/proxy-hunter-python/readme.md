**ProxyHunter v1**\

Due to the website that was used to parse proxy servers for the proxyupdate script.
it was necessary to re-write a more reliable script to obtain available servers.

ProxyHunter v1 is a CLI python3 script that  uses the `ip_ranges_US.txt` list of US ip-ranges to search out
Squid proxy servers. To use IP ranges for other countries visit: http://www.ipaddresslocation.org/ip_ranges/get_ranges.php and select your
country and select *CIDR* format from the drop-down menus and then download to your `proxyhunter` directory.

Because this script does the searching instead of relying on other data it will take some
time to search out open servers. It finds servers by pulling 2500 random ip-ranges from the
list and searches until it locates 25 open proxy servers. There is also an option to spoof
your MAC address if your network adapter allows for that, and requires root access and an external script.

**FEATURES**
 - scans most popular proxy ports(more can be added)
 - retrieves proxies from random ip ranges from country of choice (default:US)
 - writes results to file, easy to cut and paste into proxychains.conf
 - can scan single ip (eg:192.168.2.1) or ip range (eg: 192.168.2.0/24)


**FUTURE**
 - implement arguments to change vars such as `socket timeout` and single ip or ip range.
 - options to increase or decrease number of found proxies before exit
 - attempts to connect to test sites to see if proxy is valid
 - MORE!

**REQUIREMENTS**:\
*if you don't have any of these libraries installed, type: `pip3 install library`
or `sudo -H pip3 install library`*
