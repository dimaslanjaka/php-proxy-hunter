## Installation

Add this to your `requirements.txt`:

```

Then install:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt --force-reinstall
```

## Description

ProxyHunter v2 is a CLI Python 3 script that uses the `ip_ranges_US.txt` list of US IP ranges to search for open Squid proxy servers.

You can also scan for other countries by visiting:
http://www.ipaddresslocation.org/ip_ranges/get_ranges.php
Select your country, choose **CIDR** format, and download the ranges to your `proxyhunter` directory.

Unlike tools that rely on external proxy lists, ProxyHunter actively scans IP ranges.
By default, it randomly selects **2,500 IP ranges** and searches until it finds **25 open proxies**.
Optional MAC address spoofing is supported if your network adapter allows it (requires root access and an external script).

---

## Features

- Scans most popular proxy ports (more can be added)
- Retrieves proxies from random IP ranges for the country of your choice (default: US)
- Writes results to a file, making it easy to paste into `proxychains.conf`
- Can scan:
  - Single IP (e.g., `192.168.2.1`)
  - IP range (e.g., `192.168.2.0/24`)

---

## Planned Features

- Command-line arguments to change variables such as socket timeout and scan mode (single IP or IP range)
- Options to increase or decrease the number of found proxies before exit
- Attempts to connect to test sites to check if proxies are valid
- More scanning capabilities
